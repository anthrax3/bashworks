Will be stable as soon as the guide is rewritten, to be more interresting.

For now, see:
- `jpic's .bashrc` for an example bootstrap,
- the `api documentation`_ updated every hour,

.. _`api documentation`: http://bashworks.ocpsys.com/module.html
.. _`jpic's .bashrc`: http://github.com/jpic/bashworks/blob/master/module/docs/examples/jpic.bashrc.sh
