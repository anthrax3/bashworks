Roadmap
```````

Skipping directly to 0.2 without 0.1 release.

The 0.2 version aims toward modularity, ease of initial development and refactoring, even more documented API with bashdoc, and lots of fun playing around with bash with the help of #bash@irc.freenode.net.

Bootstrap script
````````````````

The bootstrap script "jpic.sh" will initiate any avalaible modules, refer to API documentation for more information.
